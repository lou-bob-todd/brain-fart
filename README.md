# Brain Fart Log (blog)

I want to write a daily portion of crappy brain farts in order to promote good content on the web. How does that make sense? Who knows. But here's what I came up with. Good content is rare, so people (including you, if you're people) will appreciate it more when there is even more shit floating around. Damn, when I put it like that, I can't help thinking I should be getting a cut from each guy making money on good content.
